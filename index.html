    <h1>My Portfolio:</h1>
    <div></div>
    <p>Hello again here is my second basic website build 
        This attempt will hopefully include lots of features like forms
        and take user inputs and be truly responsive.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>Aims for this Bootcamp:</h2>
    <div></div>
    <p>Learn and understand Javascript, Html:5, 
        and how to use expressive CSS to amke my website 
        <b>Standout!!</b><br>
        I first developed my interest in coding when having to fix an old Windows Pc <br>
        I was ushered into the world of Linux Distros starting off with the most notable <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/"target ="blank" > <br>
        OpenSuse <a>at the time was a leading mainstream distro that was easier to install for Linux Beginners(Yep I'm that old). <br>
        This first foray into coding was mostly limited to installing a working X-server and learing how to partion a hard-drive,<br>
        before deciding to reinstall windows, which is odd because <br>
        I wouldn't have been able to reinstall windows if I hadnt been through the experiences with Linux<br>
        <!-- I have <br> for seperating the text so it stacks down the page instead of across like a road rash -->

    <div><h3>Html Only Task</h3></div>
    <p> Why did I decide on Codenation to further my knowledge and career<br>
        It's a long story that began a couple of years ago when I first decided to change career<br> 
        I'm one of those annoying people in life who likes to be good at whatever I attempt<br> 
        So I've worked my way through the ranks in catering, 
        I have had the privilege of working for some of the UK's best Chef's,<br>
        Made friends that will last a lifetime but sadly never really enjoyed it,
        The joke was always I was good because I didnt want to do it,<br>
        I just like being annoying, Tell me "it's not possible" I make it happen
        So I decided to learn some new skills and take my love for taking things apart
        to new levels and see if I can make a career out of coding.<br>
        I didnt really decide on Codenation until after I had completed a short Developer Course
        Which I really enjoyed so I pushed for more<br>
        <div>
            As yet the Jury is still out as to if I have Bitten off more than I can chew.
